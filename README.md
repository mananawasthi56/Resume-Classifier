ðŸš€ Overview

The Intelligent Resume Classifier & Skill Extractor is an intermediate-level Data Science project that automatically classifies resumes into relevant job domains and extracts key skills using NLP (Natural Language Processing).

This project combines data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and a Streamlit-based user interface to provide an end-to-end intelligent resume analysis tool.

ðŸ§© Features

âœ… Resume Classification: Automatically predicts the job category of a given resume (e.g., Data Science, Web Development, HR, etc.).
âœ… Skill Extraction: Identifies and displays important technical and soft skills from the resume text.
âœ… Interactive Dashboard: Built with Streamlit â€” users can upload resumes (PDF/TXT) and view classification and extracted insights in real-time.
âœ… Data Visualization: Uses Matplotlib to show skill frequency, domain distribution, and text insights with subtle, modern charts.
âœ… Clean Preprocessing Pipeline: Handles text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization efficiently.
